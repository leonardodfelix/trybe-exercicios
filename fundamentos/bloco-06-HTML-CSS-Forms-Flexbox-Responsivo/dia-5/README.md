**Realize as seguintes tarefas:**
1. Faça o tamanho da fonte ser maior;
2. Faça o tamanho da fonte dos elementos `h1` ser menor;
3. Aumente o espaçamento entre as figuras;
4. Adicione um pouco de margin na página.
5. Guarde a largura da tela no ponto que você identificou que o layout atual não funcionou bem (por exemplo 800px) . Esse será o primeiro breakpoint do layout . Um breakpoint é apenas um ponto onde estamos definindo que o design atual deve mudar;
6. Crie uma media query no seu arquivo CSS , usando a dimensão em pixels que você guardou como o `min-width` do teste da media query . Dentro desse breakpoint , adicione os seguintes ajustes:
* Altere a cor de fundo (isso vai te ajudar a perceber quando a media query teve efeito) ;
* Ajuste o tamanho da fonte;
* Ajuste as margens da página;
* Faça as imagens serem mostradas em duas colunas.
7. Agora, você vai criar outro breakpoint para telas grandes. Redimensione sua tela de novo para encontrar um novo breakpoint .
8. Crie uma nova media query no seu arquivo CSS usando a dimensão que você encontrou para telas grandes (por exemplo 1300px) , e realize os seguintes ajustes dentro do breakpoint :
* Altere a cor de fundo;
* Ajuste o tamanho da fonte;
* Ajuste as margens da página;
* Adicione a propriedade `max-width` à página, para garantir que a largura das linhas não fique muito grande.

      <h1>
        CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole
      </h1>
      <p>
        Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
        bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
        book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
        it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or
        conversations?'
      </p>
      <p>
        So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot
        day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making
        a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the
        daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was nothing so <i>very</i> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
        <i>very</i> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh
        dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred
        to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all
        seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually <i>took a watch out of
          its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started
        to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen
        a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
        burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately
        was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
      </p>
      <p>
        In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in
        the world she was to get out again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
        dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
        about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
        well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty
        of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to
        happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was
        coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the
        sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and
        book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She
        took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled
        'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did
        not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put
        it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
      </p>
      <p>
        'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall
        think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at
        home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of
        the house!' (Which was very likely true.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Down, down, down. Would the fall <i>never</i> come to an end! 'I wonder how many
        miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting
        somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
        thousand miles down, I think&mdash;' (for, you see, Alice had learnt
        several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though
        this was not a <i>very</i> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as
        there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it
        over) '&mdash;yes, that's about the right distance&mdash;but then I wonder
        what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude
        was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right <i>through</i> the
        earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with
        their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think&mdash;' (she was rather
        glad there <i>was</i> no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the
        right word) '&mdash;but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
        country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?'
        (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke&mdash;fancy <i>curtseying</i> as you're
        falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an
        ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to
        ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
        talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'
        (Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at
        tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no
        mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very
        like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice
        began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy
        sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats
        eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't
        much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and
        had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and
        saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever
        eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of
        sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
        she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long
        passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There
        was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just
        in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers,
        how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the
        corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a
        long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
        Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
        door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get
        out again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
        glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first
        thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but,
        alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at
        any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round,
        she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was
        a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key
        in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
      </p>
      <p>
        Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much
        larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into
        the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark
        hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool
        fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; 'and
        even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it would be of
        very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like
        a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.' For, you see,
        so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to
        think that very few things indeed were really impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back
        to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate
        a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she
        found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said
        Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words
        'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not
        going to do <i>that</i> in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see
        whether it's marked "<i>poison</i>" or not'; for she had read several nice little
        histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts
        and other unpleasant things, all because they <i>would</i> not remember the
        simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker
        will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger
        <i>very</i> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten
        that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost
        certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this bottle was <i>not</i> marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste
        it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of
        cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered
        toast,) she very soon finished it off.

**Realize as seguintes tarefas:**
1. Utilizando a abordagem *mobile first e media queries* , **crie três versões de layout diferentes para essa página** . Cada *layout* deve corresponder a um tamanho diferente de página (*pequeno, médio e grande*) . Faça pelo menos um commit para cada layout ;  

2. Para fazer isso de forma adequada, você deve prestar atenção no conteúdo da página e pensar em como mostrá-lo em cada um dos tamanhos de tela:
* Onde a lista de capítulos deve estar posicionada?
* Como a história deve ser mostrada?
* Como o cabeçalho deve ser posicionado?
* O que fazer com as informações do autor em cada tamanho de tela?
3. Talvez você precise alterar o *HTML* um pouco, adicionando elementos para facilitar a estilização, ou talvez mudando um bloco de lugar dentro da página.

        <h2>
          Welcome!
        </h2>
        <img src="http://placebear.com/400/400">
        <p>The domestic cat[1][2] (Felis catus[2] or Felis silvestris catus[4], informally Felis domesticus[6][7]) is a
          small, usually furry, domesticated, carnivorous mammal. It is often called the housecat when kept as an indoor
          pet,[8] or simply the cat when there is no need to distinguish it from other felids and felines. Cats are
          valued by humans for companionship and ability to hunt vermin and household pests. They are primarily
          nocturnal.[9]
        </p>
        <p>Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp
          retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. As crepuscular predators, cats use their acute
          hearing and ability to see in near darkness to locate prey. Not only can cats hear sounds too faint for human
          ears, they can also hear sounds higher in frequency than humans can perceive. This is because the usual prey
          of cats (particularly rodents such as mice) make high frequency noises, so the hearing of the cat has evolved
          to pinpoint these faint high-pitched sounds. Cats also have a much better sense of smell than humans.

        <p>Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species, and cat communication includes the use of a
          variety of vocalizations (meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting) as well as pheromones
          and types of cat-specific body language.[10]
